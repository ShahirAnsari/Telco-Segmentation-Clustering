# Telcom-Customers-Segmentation-Clustering Using Tensorlow
**Clustering customers of Telco Company (Machine Learning)**
The goal of this project is to apply analytical techniques to predict a customer churn and analyse the churning and non-churning customers by using data from an internet connection company. Due to dealing with customers remotely can make it difficult to determine whether a customer is satisfied with the company or not.
The task was to find the factors which contribute to churn. And have a system through which we could identify such customer which could also help them decide who the one who could not be retained are and the customer who could be retained
what should be the appropriate incentive for them. They have goal to bring down the churn
rate to the minimum.
> Using K-means Clustering Technique.
